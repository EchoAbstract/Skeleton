      h3 About Skeleton?
      p.
        Skeleton is a small collection of well-organized CSS files that can
        help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it
        a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone. It's based on a responsive grid, but
        also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, forms and media
        queries. Go ahead, resize this super basic page to see the grid in
        action.

      h3 Three Core Principles
      p Skeleton is built on three core principles:
      ul.square
        li <strong>A Responsive Grid Down To Mobile</strong>: Elegant scaling from a browser to tablets to mobile.
        li <strong>Fast to Start</strong>: It's a tool for rapid development with best practices
        li <strong>Style Agnostic</strong>: It provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten.
